# Fusion360Addins
Add-in modules for Fusion360

## SaveAllStlsand3MF.py
This script loops through all the modules in a Fusion360 file and exports all of the bodies as STLs and 3MFs

## Suggestions for future work
* SaveAllStland3MF.py
* * This should warn before overwriting existing files.
* * The code for the status bar does not actually "work".
* Ideas
* * A script to send multiple bodies to a 3D printing slicer, e.g. prusaslicer instead of sending them to multiple instances of prusaslicer.
* * A script to export a fusion 360 project, i.e. the f3d file, STLs, 3mfs, DWG/DXF?, the comments, etc to a folder to make it easier to check into github.
